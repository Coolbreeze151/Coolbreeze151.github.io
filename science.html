        <h2>My experience participating in Science 2025 Hackathon</h2>
        <hr class="small">
        <p class="sciencetext">Participating in the Science 2025 Hackathon organised by the Singapore Science Centre was one of the wildest things I had ever done in 2018. The hackathon was held between 1 - 2 December which was a few days before our university final examinations. Nevertheless, it was an amazing opportunity to learn how technology can be utilised to improve both communication and learning in the field of Science. Blessed with likeminded #YOLO friends that had the same passion for tech, we decided to take a plunge despite the many school commitments and deadlines to meet. On 24 November 2018, we had an opportunity to attend workshops on various technology that we could make use of as part of the hackathon. These workshops covered topics such as <a href="https://microbit.org/" target="_blank">Microbit</a>, <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a> and 3D Model Printing. It generally gave us a good exposure to the technologies that we could make use of as participants.

        <h4><strong>Helping to achieve the Discovery of Everyday Science</strong></h4>
        <hr class="small">
        <p class="sciencetext">Many problem statements were released for us to consider tackling with communication and learning of science in 2025 as the overarching theme for this hackathon. After much discussion within our team, we decided to work on the problem statement "Discovery of Everyday Science". Our team wanted to empower everyone to discover everyday science better. There has always been a huge problem to engage the wider public with the science of today. Thats why it makes it ever more important to engage the community in co-creating just in time content for the wider audience in the community. With this in mind, our group conceptualized ScientiApp, a platform that enables the public to receive curated science content that are relevant while giving them the chance to crowdsource their own science ideas and experiments on the platform itself. We believe that having features such as voting, leaderboard scores and showcasing of best ideas on the platform can better enable the discovery of everyday science for everyone.

        <h4><strong>Prototyping & Demo</strong></h4>
        <hr class="small">
        <p class="sciencetext">As part of our crowdsourcing platform, we wanted to make it easier for the public to share their winning ideas and experiments without having to worry about the hassle of setting up or showcasing their experiments which can be cumbersome and time consuming. Thus, our team devised a prototype where users could record the experiment once and display it in the form of an Augmented Reality. Users simply had to record the experiment once and tag it on any object in the vicinity. After which, any user can simply watch the experiment by directing their phones at the tagged object itself. The technology that we adopted was <a href="https://www.hpreveal.com/" target="_blank">HP Reveal</a> which had its own set of API for easier integration and scalability. We created a simple demo of our prototype using two well-known exhibits at the Science Centre as seen below. One of the key advantages of this was that it could significantly help reduce manpower and effort needed to showcase everyday science for the public.

        <h4><strong>The Two Minute Pitch</strong></h4>
        <hr class="small">
        <p class="sciencetext">
          At the end of the 2-day hackathon, we had to give a 2-minute pitch in front of a panel of judges and to the remaining 20 teams that were present that day. As part of the pitch, we had to introduce our story and idea. We needed to explain why our idea was timely, unique, important and of interest to our audience. Despite having had plenty of experiences in presenting ideas and solutions in front of crowds, it was my first time pitching within a short stipulated time with little or no time to prepare. Therefore I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous when pitching on behalf of the team. The pitching session was a fulfilling experience that brought out more ideas especially during the panellist discussion and questions posed by the audience. For instance, our pitch initially revolved around the use of AR to showcase experiments within empty and underutilised spaces within the Science Centre but only after the panel discussions did we realise how our idea could be applicable towards outdoor events to engage the wider public.

        Our efforts during the pitch were duly recognized and I'm glad to share that we managed to clinch a top 5 placing along with a Special Mention Award! All in all, I had no regrets participating in this hackathon with my peers despite our hectic school schedule. One of my greatest takeaway during this hackathon was how we should stay open to new ideas and strive to stay creative in pursuit of innovation. There were many amazing ideas pitched that day from the use of chatbots to interact with users, to having assisted bots to guide physically challenged visitors at the Science Centre, and even the use of Machine Learning to assist students in learning Science more easily. It's definitely a great time to be alive because there is so much opportunities that Science can offer which we can look forward to in the future!
