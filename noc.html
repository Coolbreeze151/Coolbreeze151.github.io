        <h2>My 2 week entrepreneurial experience in Israel & Germany</h2>
        <hr class="small">
        <p  class="noctext">I had the privilege to be a part of the NUS Overseas Study Mission (OSM) under the NUS Overseas Colleges Programme. The OSM consisted of two weeks where we visited and studied the start-up ecosystem in both Germany and Israel. It was nothing short of extraordinary. While there are so many learning points I would like to share from my trip, I will do my best to keep it short and highlight key takeaways from the OSM trip.
        Firstly, I had the opportunity to attend entrepreneurship programmes from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and IDC Herzliya which are institutions known for their rigorous entrepreneurial development programme.
        <br/><br/>
        In IDC Herzliya, we had the chance to attend an ideation workshop where we learnt various ideation techniques. <a href = "https://au.linkedin.com/in/eli-itin-0007032">Eli Itin</a>, a senior innovation consultant, shared with us the importance of defining a problem statement that we wanted to address in a structured manner which was my main takeaway from the workshop. At times, we always want to address many big problems, but we fail to grasp the exact issue that we want to solve. I valued this a lot as many at times, there are instances where we would get periods of mental blocks that we would not be able to find solutions to address the problems. The brainwriting session among group members was also invaluable as it gave me a better understanding of how we can address these setbacks during the ideation stage in the long run.
        <br/><br/>
        Additionally, our entrepreneurship workshop conducted by TUM has provided me with greater insight on the start-up ecosystem & key comparisons between the different ecosystems in Singapore, Israel and Munich. While there were differences between our start-up ecosystems, there was one similarity amongst them that I felt stood out. This was none other than the concept of how it takes a village to raise a start-up. In all three ecosystems, the starts-ups receive support from different stakeholders to help in their development. For the case of Munich, they have 3 entrepreneurship universities that drive the start-up ecosystem. They also have MNCs such as IBM Watson that have invested and positioned their headquarters in Munich with the focus towards driving innovative technological solutions. Israel has their accelerator and incubator programmes to help support the start-up ecosystem along with strong partnerships with the government in deep technology development to help their hi-tech start-ups grow. In addition, there are many grants and mentorship available to help start-ups grow and develop within these ecosystems. With all these in mind, my key takeaway was that we need to always be aware of the many opportunities to garner support for your start-up from different stakeholders. What is important is that we take full advantage of the available support and collaboration in the ecosystem to allow these start-ups to thrive.

        <hr class="small">
        <p class="noctext">Beyond the workshops we attended, we had to opportunity to visit various companies and start-ups to learn about the different challenges they faced. Here are some of my key takeaways during the trip;
        <br/><br/>

        <strong>Fail Early, Fail Fast, Fail Inexpensively</strong>
        <br/>
        One major takeaway from the company visits was the importance of being able to accept failures quickly. Throughout the company visits we experienced, almost all the founders were in the same tune when it came to the need to experience and accept failures. Failure was the root to success for many Israelis in general. For many of the founders we met in Israel, they shared about how failures provide the best platform for them to learn quickly so that they can avoid the same mistakes again, citing examples of their past start-ups that have failed which led to the present successes in their respective start-ups. I felt this was extremely applicable to the Asian culture where we are sometimes too critical about failures thus inhibiting our motivation to venture and test out new ideas. As cliché it may sound, it is important to remember that most us usually fail at achieving something in our first attempt. Thus, with Israel’s chutzpah culture that is accepting of failure, I learnt to appreciate that there is nothing to lose if we fail once on an idea. Instead, we have everything to gain from the mistakes we made through these failures enabling us to invest more capital and time at the right areas in our future ventures. Hence, failing fast & inexpensively has since become one of the many key takeaways from my trip.
        <br/><br/>

        <strong>Change is the Only Constant</strong><br/>
        During our visit to a Bosch industrial factory, one of the managers shared this quote;<br/><br/>

        <i>CFO: What happens if we train them and they leave? <br/>
        CEO: What happens if we don’t and they stay?</i>
        <br/><br/>
        This had a lot of relevance and impact to me in how we should view businesses and start-ups especially when it came to adapt to change. For the case of Bosch, there was a constant need for them to upgrade their workers to help them stay up to date with the technological advancement. If not for the fact that they provided opportunities to train and upgrade their skills, they may have found it difficult to stay up to date and in managing new automation processes in the drilling manufacturing industry. The fact that Bosch was constantly willing to accept new changes in automation and training of new skills for its workers to stay relevant to new machinery ensured that the company remained competitive and successful in the market. Thus, it was a valuable example of how we need to constantly plan and adapt to changes to stay successful. 
        <br/><br/>
        Another example would have to be Porsche from the automobile industry. At the Porsche museum we visited, I had to opportunity to learn how Porsche had to constantly innovate and develop better cars in the market. This was especially so during the financial crisis when customers were less likely to purchase their cars. Porsche’s constant need to adapt to such changes and to innovate resulted in the creation of the revolutionary Boxster engines which helped the company to survive through the financial and oil crisis. Hence, through the examples of Bosch and Porsche, I have learnt that we should never be complacent about past successes and that it is always important to constantly change, plan and seize new opportunities for the future whenever possible. We can never be too sure on how new technology and external developments can easily disrupt a start-up or business, hence the need to constantly learn new things and prepare for the future.

        <strong>Product Vs Market Fit</strong>
        <br/>
        My next takeaway from the OSM trip was the need to have flexibility between product development and market fit. During my NUS Overseas College curriculum, through the lean start-up model, we were taught the importance of identifying and validating the pain points and a market fit before developing a product to address the problem. However, during my OSM, there were cases where more attention was placed in product development before finding a right market fit. This gave me a more profound understanding on the pros and cons when deciding between developing a product or finding a right market fit first. For example, one of the start-ups by the name of Gemsense was focused in developing an IOT sensor. Given that it was a new technology developed in the market, the advantage was that it made it easier for them to penetrate different industry markets with an added first mover advantage along with its patented technology. However, its focus on developing the product first also came with many challenges. While they had many businesses from varying industries interested in their technology, the founder shared that they initially had trouble finding the right market fit for their product especially in the consumer industry. In addition, for the different industries that they were catering to, they had to constantly innovate and customise their product to meet the requirements of their clients’ pain points. This showed that depending on the product and problem we want to solve, we need to exercise flexibility between developing the product and finding the right market fit to ensure that the company constantly has a direction to follow.

          These were some of the key takeaways I had from my OSM trip. It was a humbling experience to be a part of a programme that offered many learning opportunities. The startup environment is one that is constantly changing and offers many opportunities to not only learn and grow from but to also help change the world. There are still many experiences from the OSM I would like to share but I believe a video montage below would be the best tool for me to sum it up. So sit back, relax and hope you enjoy the video!
