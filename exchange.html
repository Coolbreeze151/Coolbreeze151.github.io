        <h2>My Exchange Experience!</h2>
        <hr class="small">
        <p class="exchangetext">My exchange experience in Hong Kong was nothing short of amazing. It was my first time living overseas with the opportunity to be more independent & responsible for my own well-being. In terms of academic experience, I had the chance to work with many local & international students in my exchange school, Hong Kong University of Science & Technology. 

        What came as an initial surprise to me was how direct & upfront these students were in voicing out their opinions & ideas. I was initially overwhelmed, but with time I gained new perspective! Their upfront nature was what helped us get through the many difficult projects & assignments in school. Many of these students I met were very caring & friendly. They even offered to bring me around Hong Kong after school hours which I was extremely grateful for. Their honest & upfront nature was something I valued & took away from this trip!

        <p  class="exchangetext">Besides school, there were a few challenges I faced as well as observations I made & learnt from during my stay in Hong Kong;
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Halal Food!</strong><br/>
        During my first few weeks, I had some difficulties searching for halal food. Nevertheless, nothing is impossible! After some research I managed to get my hands on quite a few halal spots that offered local cuisines from duck rice to dim sums! If you’re someone looking for halal options, don’t hesitate to reach out to me & I’ll share with you more about the different places you can go to! As a start you can check this <a href="https://www.havehalalwilltravel.com/" target="_blank">link</a> out if you’re looking for halal places outside of Singapore.

        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Water Scarcity</strong><br/>
        Unlike Singapore, Hong Kong’s tap water supply is not safe to drink directly from. Thus, most of our water consumption had to come from designated water coolers which were limited compared to Singapore. While the situation was not as dire as other countries, it taught me a lot on the importance of water management. On this note, I recently read & found out that just like Singapore, Hong Kong had its fair share of challenges when it came to water management. You can read more about it from an online report <a href="http://civic-exchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Water-Report-English-final.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. 

        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Efficient Transportation System</strong><br/>
        One amazing observation I had was on how efficient Hong Kong’s transport system was which came as a surprise to me. I was extremely fortunate to get from one place to another through their public buses & MTR train regardless of location. Here in Hong Kong, their buses & trains were scheduled beforehand & the time of departure was constantly communicated to waiting passengers which I felt contributed to stronger public confidence in Hong Kong’s transport system. The need to only tap once instead of twice when using public buses also added a lot of convenience to normal public users. Coincidentally, all this happened while there were <a href="https://mothership.sg/2017/12/lta-report-mrt-bishan-tunnel-flooding/" target="_blank">train disruptions</a> back in Singapore owing to many reasons such as the flooding & signal faults. Having had my fair share of experience of train disruptions in Singapore, my time in Hong Kong gave me new perspective in terms of how we can continuously learn & improve by looking at models adopted by other countries. 
        <br/><br/>
        Finally, one of the key highlights of my exchange was being able to hike the UNESCO Global Geopark & the Dragon's Back Trail. While Hong Kong is normally associated with a crowded & busy lifestyle, it also offered open, peaceful areas & a glimpse of how beautiful mother nature can be. Venturing out of Singapore may seem daunting & uncomfortable but having had the chance to discover these hidden gems has helped me overcome my fear of going outside my comfort zone & gave me a newfound appreciation on the importance of taking care of our environment.

        My exchange programme in Hong Kong has been an eye opener filled with new knowledge in & out of school. I have made many new friends in Hong Kong that I continue to keep in touch with today! With that, I’ll end by leaving you with a quote, “Travel makes one modest, you see what a tiny place you occupy in the world” – Gustave Flaubert.
